Disclaimer: I'm a fan of 37signals. They do have some great advice, and they do provide some useful apps. But they're only useful to a point. Here's why...

### Ta-Da list

While looking for a cross-platform todo list app (iPhone, Mac Dashboard, Firefox plugin, web-based) I came across tada list. Sure, no FF plugin, but the other bases are covered. I'd tried it before when it first came out, but opening a web-page & log in to type maybe 2 words seemed a little bit of a pain and gave up, and since now it has iPhone integration I thought I'd give it another shot.

I went to the sign-up page and entered my details. Upon submit I was presented with an error message:

    1 error prohibited this new account from being saved
    There were problems with the following fields:
        * Email address has already been taken

My thought process was thus: 

> Ok, so I already have an account somewhere... I'll just use that. Now, where's the "forgotten password" link... er... hey, there's no way to recover my account on this page! Right, must be on the home page then... er... hey, there's no way to get back to the home page!

There's also no openid integration like there is with basecamp and highrise.
